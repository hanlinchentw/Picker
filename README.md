# Picker

Abstract:

This is Han lin's second iOS app, it's work with another UI Desinger called Casey Hou.
This app heavily use Firebase. I think maybe is better for myself to use AWS, but it's a bit too late.
Maybe I would use AWS for backend on next side project.
BTW: This is the first app created by code only (without storyboard) for me.

Introduction:

The primary job of Picker is to solve the problem that user can't decide what to eat.
Picker can show user restaurants nearby, top rated, most popular, etc. 
User can choose whatever they want to eat, and the lucky will make the choice for them, and boom.
Got the lunch (not real lunch but the choice).
